## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This helped me get a better grasp on coding as a whole. its been a year since i coded anything and using this as a refresher and intro assignment really helped reawaken the knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

All of it coding is a part of a fun and confusing art form, im thrilled to master but still struggling to understand and connect all the dots.
